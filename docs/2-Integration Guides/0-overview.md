## Before starting

It is better to walk before start running. If you have not read the first sections yet, please see components descriptions for any of the services you may be interested. These pages will provide you the background you need to start your integration.

- [VIDcredentials](../1-Components/0-vidcredential.md)
- [VIDconnect](../1-Components/1-vidconnect.md)
- [VIDwallet](../1-Components/2-vidwallet.md)
- [eIDAS Bridge](../1-Components/3-eidas-bridge.md)

## Integration guidelines

In this section you can find direct access to the integration guides to all our components. We provide integration guides to support our customers to integrate our components into their services. In other words, the integration guides provide the necessary information to integrate the VIDchain component into a target system. Then, if you are an integrator, feel free to pick the integration guide you need and follow the step-by-step guidelines provided for your integration process.

#Â Integration example

Aside from specific integration guides, an [integration example](integration-example) is provided as a final subsection to see a typical integration scenario where multiple services are used in the same use case. You can take the journey presented in the integration example as an inspiration for your use occurrence.
