# Get the VIDwallet app

As a user, in order to create keys, receive credentials, use them and be able to complete the tutorial you will need a wallet.

You can download the VIDchain reference wallet here:

- [Android Version from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.validatedid.wallet)

Once installed, the first time you open the app youâ€™ll be asked to define a PIN code or to authenticate using your biometrics (used to encrypt the keys). As soon as you open the wallet, your keys will be created.

The application has four views:

- **Credentials**: list of all the credentials you own and store in your wallet.
- **Login**: where you can scan a QR code presented by a web page the user asks to authenticate in.
- **Notifications**: list of all the notifications you receive from a credentials provider, like .
- **Settings**

And also a top right (+) button that you can use to self-issue your first Verifiable Credentials.
