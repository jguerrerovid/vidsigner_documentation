An identity wallet represents one of the core components in an SSI system and so does it in VIDchain. Our identity wallet, the VIDwallet, is a smartphone-based identity wallet aiming to implement the digital counterpart of a physical wallet. This wallet is used by the users to store and protect their assets such as key material, identifier and personal information.  

VIDwallet is designed to act ledger-agnostic meaning that it does not rely on a single DLT or blockchain network. VIDwallet supports already several DLTs and blockchain networks such as EBSI and Ethereum to just name two but it can also be used without distributed network utilizing the DID key[^1] method. Additionally, it does not only supports EBSI identifiers but is also fully EBSI compliant[^2] with their services.
